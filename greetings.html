      Some people pronounce "kamusta" but this is wrong, I encourage you to
      pronounce "kumusta" but at the end of the day it's up to you.
      <div>
        Also keep in mind that "kumusta ka?" and "kumusta?", or even "kumusta
        kayo?" (plural) are recommended to use ONLY if you are familiar with the
        person (friends, same age, family, etc.)

      Even though "kayo" means "you" (plural), you can use it here for both
      single person and more than one person. Using "kayo" to a single person
      shows even more respect.

      Rin means too, also or either. Rin is commonly used after words ending in
      a vowel, Din is commonly used after words ending in a consonant but this
      rule is not strict.
