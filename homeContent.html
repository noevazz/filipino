    <h3>Tagalog</h3>
    <p>
      The word "Tagalog" is believed to come from the term "taga-ilog",
      which roughly translates to "people of the river" or "river
      dwellers."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is derived from the words "taga", meaning "from" or "people of,"
      and "ilog", meaning "river."
    </p>
    <p>
      Historically, the Tagalog people lived near the rivers in the region
      of Luzon in the Philippines..

    <h3>Tagalog & Filipino</h3>
    <p>
      While Filipino and Tagalog are often used interchangeably, Filipino
      incorporates words from other Philippine languages and foreign
      languages, making it a more standardized version used for
      communication across the nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tagalog, on the other hand, refers specifically to the language
      spoken by people from the Tagalog region in Luzon.
