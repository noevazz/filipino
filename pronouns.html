  <h3>Pronouns Overview</h3>

  <p class="fw-bold">What is a pronoun?</p>

  <p>A pronoun is a word that replaces a noun in a sentence.</p>

  <div class="card bg-secondary text-white">
    <div class="card-body">
      A <span class="fw-bold">noun</span> is a word that represents a person,
      place, thing, or idea. It is one of the basic building blocks of a
      sentence.
      <div>
        So, a noun can be a subject, but not all nouns are subjects. A noun
        becomes the subject when it plays that role in the sentence.

  <div class="card">
    <div class="card-body">
      <ul>
        <li>noun: apple (represents a thing).</li>
        <li>pronoun: it (you can replace "apple" with the "it" pronoun).</li>
        <li>
          subject: an noun and a pronoun can be subjects if they play that role
          in a sentence.
        </li>
      </ul>

  <p>
    <span class="dotted-underline" title="Personal pronouns"
      >Panhalip Panao</span
    >
    are divided into three groups
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><kbd>Ang group</kbd>: Used to <span class="badge bg-primary">indicate the subject</span> or the focus of the sentence. It highlights the entity performing the action or being described.</li>
    <li><kbd>Ng group</kbd>: Used for <span class="badge bg-primary">possession</span> or to describe the object affected by the action. It shows ownership or is used with the object of the sentence.</li>
    <li><kbd>Sa group</kbd>: Used to <span class="badge bg-primary">indicate direction</span>, location, or the recipient of an action (indirect object). Itâ€™s similar to saying "to," "at," or "for" in English.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Here is a table with the three groups:</p>
