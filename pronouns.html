<h3>Pronouns</h3>

<p class="fw-bold">What is a pronoun?</p>

<p>A pronoun is a word that replaces a noun in a sentence.</p>

<div class="card bg-secondary text-white">
  <div class="card-body">A <span class="fw-bold">noun</span> is a word that represents a person, place, thing, or idea. It is one of the basic building blocks of a sentence.
    <div>So, a noun can be a subject, but not all nouns are subjects. A noun becomes the subject when it plays that role in the sentence.</div>
  </div>
</div>
<br />

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    <div>noun: apple (represents a thing).</div>
    <div>pronoun: it (you can replace "apple" with the "it" pronoun).</div>
    <div>subject: an noun and a pronoun can be subjects if they play that role in a sentence.</div>
  </div>

</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ang group</li>

<p>Here is a table with the three groups:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">

          <th scope="col">Pronoun Group</th>
          <th scope="col">Singular/Plural</th>
          <th scope="col">Ang Group</th>
          <th scope="col">Ng Group</th>
          <th scope="col">Sa Group</th>

  <div class="card-body">
    "Ay" is <span class="fw-bold">NOT</span> a verb like "to be" in English.
    Instead, it is a linking word (sometimes called an inversion marker) used in
    formal or literary Filipino sentences to connect the subject and predicate,
    often giving the sentence a more poetic or archaic tone. It typically
    appears in sentences that invert the typical subject-predicate order.
    <div>It is usually omitted in common conversations.</div>
