  <h4>Root And Affixes</h4>

  <p>
    In Filipino, <span class="fw-bold">roots (ugat)</span> and
    <span class="fw-bold">affixes (panlapi)</span> are essential parts of word
    formation.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A <kbd>root word</kbd> is the base
    form of a word that carries the core meaning. It can stand alone or be
    modified with affixes to create new words.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    An <kbd>affix</kbd> is a word part
    (prefix, infix, or suffix) that is added to a root word to modify its
    meaning.

        More about the um infix
        </p>
        <p>
          The <kbd>-um-</kbd> infix helps to indicate the tense of the verb:
          <p>
            Root word in this example: <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary">takbo</span> /
            <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-success">run</span>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Past Tense</span>: <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary">tumakbo</span> (we already saw thi in the kumain example)</li>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Present Tense</span>: <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary">tumatakbo</span>
            <p>Here "-um-" was added and the first syllable was repeated</p>
            </li>
            <li>This is not related to the <kbd>-um-</kbd> infix but just for your knowledge. The <span class="fw-bold">future</span> tense is created repeating the first syllable:
              <p>
                <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary">tatakbo</span>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <div>
            <p>If you struggled to understand the present tense example, here is a further explanation:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>root word: <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary">takbo</span></li>
              <li>add um: <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary">tumakbo</span> (past tense)</li>
              <li>now repeat the first syllable of the root word: <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary">tumatakbo</span> (present tense)</li>
            </ul>

        related to the root word. It typically turns the root into a noun that
        refers to a place where the action of the root word occurs.
