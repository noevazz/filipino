  <p>
    In filipino, roots (ugat) and affixes (panlapi) are essential parts of word
    formation.
  </p>

  <p>
    A root word is the base form of a word that carries the core meaning. It can
    stand alone or be modified with affixes to create new words.
  </p>

  <p>Affixes are added to root words to change their meaning or function.</p>

      <div class="fw-bold">TO REMEMBER:</div>
      A <span class="fw-bold">noun</span> is a word that represents a person,
      place, thing, or idea. It is one of the basic building blocks of a
      sentence.
      <p class="text-warning fw-bold">
          nouns can refer to tangible things (like bahay for "house") or
          abstract concepts (like talino for "intelligence")
      </p>
      <div>
        So, a noun can be a subject, but not all nouns are subjects. A noun
        becomes the subject when it plays that role in the sentence.
      </div>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="fw-bold">noun</span>: apple (represents a thing).</li>
      <li><span class="fw-bold">pronoun</span>: it (you can replace "apple" with the "it" pronoun).</li>
      <li>
        <span class="fw-bold">subject</span>: an noun and a pronoun can be subjects if they play that role in
        a sentence.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h5>ðŸ“Œ Ma</h5>

  <p>The prefix <kbd>ma</kbd> turns a noun into an adjective.</p>

  <p>Example:</p>

  <table class="table table-bordered table-striped text-center">
    <tr>
      <td>talino</td>
      <td>matalino</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>intelligence</td>
      <td>smart</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="2">
        <p>matalino siya</p>
        <p>(he/she is smart)</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
