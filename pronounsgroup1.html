        In Filipino, "s" sounds like "sh" when followed by "y" or a "y" sound,
        as in "siya" (sha). Otherwise, it retains the regular "s" sound, as in
        "sila" (see-la).

      "Ay" is <span class="fw-bold">NOT</span> a verb like "to be" in English.
      Instead, it is a linking word (sometimes called an inversion marker) used
      in formal or literary Filipino sentences to connect the subject and
      predicate, often giving the sentence a more poetic or archaic tone. It
      typically appears in sentences that invert the typical subject-predicate
      order.
