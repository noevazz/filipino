  <h4>Alphabet</h4>

  <p>
    In the Philippines, the writing system and alphabet have evolved over time:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <span class="fw-bold">Abecedario</span>: This was the Spanish-influenced
      alphabet used during the Spanish colonial period. It consisted of 32
      letters, including Spanish-specific ones like "Ch," "Ll," and "Ñ."
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <span class="fw-bold">Abakada</span>: Introduced by Lope K. Santos in
      1940, this was the native Filipino alphabet with 20 letters: A, B, K, D,
      E, G, H, I, L, M, N, Ng, O, P, R, S, T, U, W, and Y. It was designed to
      better represent the sounds of native Filipino languages.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <span class="fw-bold">Alpabetong Filipino</span>: The current Filipino
      alphabet, adopted in 1987, has 28 letters, incorporating the original
      Abakada and adding the letters C, F, J, Ñ, Q, V, X, and Z to represent
      sounds from foreign words and indigenous languages.
    </li>
  </ul>

      <p>
        Note: Do not get confuse by the pronunciation of the alphabet and the
        actual pronunciation in words, initial <kbd>p</kbd>, <kbd>t</kbd>,
        <kbd>k</kbd> are <span class="fw-bold">unaspirated</span>, if you speak
        Spanish you are good with this part but if you are an English speaking
        student you must be careful not to heavily aspirate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note2: In English and Spanish we usually encounter <kbd>ng</kbd> at the
        middle or at the end of a word.
      </p>
      <p>
        In filipino you will also encounter <kbd>ng</kbd>
        <span class="fw-bold">at the beginning</span> of a word
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been trying to find a video about this, and I found some, but the
        one I like is the one below, it does not talk about pronouncing
        <kbd>ng</kbd> at the beginning but I like how the guy teaches the
        <kbd>pangalan</kbd> word syllable by syllable, so you can use it to
        learn how to pronounce <kbd>ng</kbd> as one syllable.
