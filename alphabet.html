  <p>
    In the Philippines, the writing system and alphabet have evolved over time:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <span class="fw-bold">Abecedario</span>: This was the Spanish-influenced
      alphabet used during the Spanish colonial period. It consisted of 32
      letters, including Spanish-specific ones like "Ch," "Ll," and "Ñ."
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <span class="fw-bold">Abakada</span>: Introduced by Lope K. Santos in
      1940, this was the native Filipino alphabet with 20 letters: A, B, K, D,
      E, G, H, I, L, M, N, Ng, O, P, R, S, T, U, W, and Y. It was designed to
      better represent the sounds of native Filipino languages.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <span class="fw-bold">Alpabetong Filipino</span>: The current Filipino
      alphabet, adopted in 1987, has 28 letters, incorporating the original
      Abakada and adding the letters C, F, J, Ñ, Q, V, X, and Z to represent
      sounds from foreign words and indigenous languages.
    </li>
  </ul>
