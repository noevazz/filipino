    <h5>The Ang Marker</h5>
  </div>

  <p><kbd>Ang</kbd> is a subject marker used to indicate the focus or topic of a sentence.</p>

  <p>
    It functions similarly to the definite article <kbd>the</kbd> in English but has a more grammatical role in
    structuring sentences.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Marks the subject of the sentence:</p>
      <p>
        <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary">Tumatahol ang aso</span>
        /
        <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-success">The dog is barking.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary">Kumakain ang batang lalaki</span>
        /
        <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-success">The boy is eating.</span>
      </p>
      <p>Ang marks "batang lalaki" ("the boy") as the subject of the sentence.</p>
      <p class="text-secondary">Another example just to expand your vocabulary:</p>
      <p>
        <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary">Umiinom ang batang babae</span>
        /
        <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-success">The girl is drinking.</span>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Used in questions to identify or describe something:</p>
      <p>
        <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary">Ano ang pangalan mo?</span>
        /
        <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-success">What is your name?.</span>
      </p>
      <p>Ang marks "pangalan" ("name") as the noun that is the focus of the question.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><kbd>Ang</kbd> is not exlusive to people</p>
      <p>
        <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary">magkano ang ice cream?</span>
        /
        <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-success">How much is the ice cream?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="fw-bold">It can be used for things, places, ideas, animals, etc. What matters is that it marks the focused subject of the sentence ‚Äî the main thing being talked about.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <div class="card mb-4 p-2 bg-danger">
    <p class="fw-bold">Is <kbd>ang</kbd> like <kbd>the</kbd> in English?</p>
    <p>Yes... and also not exactly üòÖ</p>
    <ul>
      <li><kbd>Ang</kbd> and <kbd>the</kbd> seem similar because they both come before nouns.</li>
      <li>In English, <kbd>the</kbd> just makes a noun specific; it doesn't mark its role in the sentence.</li>
      <li><kbd>Ang</kbd> has a grammatical function, it marks the subject that is in focus.</li>
    </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>The verb "gusto" is an object-focus verb.</li>

        <li>"ng lalaki" is the experiencer of the feeling like, but he is not the focus.</li>
        <li>Because the verb is object-focus, the focus/object is marked with ang, and the doer/experiencer is marked with ng.</li>
