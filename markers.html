  <h5>The Ang Marker</h5>

  <p>
    <kbd>Ang</kbd> is a subject marker used to indicate the focus or topic of a
    sentence.
  </p>

  <p>
    It functions similarly to the definite article <kbd>the</kbd> in English but
    has a more grammatical role in structuring sentences.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Marks the subject of the sentence:</p>
      <p>
        <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary"
          >Kumakain ang batang lalaki</span
        >
        /
        <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-success">The boy is eating.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Ang marks "batang lalaki" ("the boy") as the subject of the sentence.
      </p>
      <p class="text-secondary">Another example just to expand your vocabulary:</p>
      <p>
        <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary"
          >Umiinom ang batang babae</span
        >
        /
        <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-success">The girl is drinking.</span>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Used in questions to identify or describe something:</p>
      <p>
        <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary">Ano ang pangalan mo?</span>
        /
        <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-success">What is your name?.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Ang marks "pangalan" ("name") as the noun that is the focus of the
        question.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

        Finally, you can also find <kbd>ng</kbd> as one word, it means "of" and
        it is pronounced as "nang".

        english, example:
