  <h4>How To Say "Also/Too"</h4>

  <div class="card p-2 mb-4">
    <p>
      <code>rin</code> and <code>din</code> both mean "also" or "too", and they are interchangeable in meaning, but
      their usage depends on the sound of the word that comes before them.
    </p>

    <p class="fw-bold">🤓 Basic rule (not recommended to learn):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use <code>rin</code> after words that end in a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) or letters “w” and “y”.</li>
      <li>Use <code>din</code> after words that end in a consonant except “w” and “y.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>👉 The rule aboce looks at how the word is written, not how it's pronounced.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="alert alert-warning mb-4">
    <p><span class="fw-bold">⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️</span></p>
    <p>
      In Filipino, a word ending in a vowel with a <span class="fw-bold">glottal stop</span> (like "ka", "siya", or
      "Maria") is treated phonetically like a consonant, so we use "rin."
    </p>
    <p>
      A <code>glottal stop</code> is a type of sound made by briefly closing the vocal cords, stopping the airflow, and
      then releasing it. It's the sound you hear in the middle of the English interjection:
    </p>
    <p>"uh-oh" → the little pause between “uh” and “oh” is a glottal stop.</p>
    <p>
      In phonetics, it's written as [ʔ] and in Tagalog, it's very common at the ends of words that appear to end in
      vowels.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Filipino, many words that end in a vowel are actually pronounced with a glottal stop at the end, especially
      when spoken in isolation or stressed. So words like:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>ka</li>
      <li>siya</li>
      <li>bata</li>
      <li>Maria</li>
    </ul>
    <p>are often pronounced like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ka?</li>
      <li>siya?</li>
      <li>bata?</li>
      <li>Maria?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      That tiny pause/catch in your throat at the end makes the vowel feel “cut off,” and this is what makes the word
      phonetically act like it ends in a consonant — so we use "rin" instead of "din."

  <div class="card p-2 mb-4">
    <p class="fw-bold">⭐ Phonetic/Modern Rule (Based on pronunciation/sound):</p>
    <p>
      This rule is based on how the word actually sounds when spoken, especially considering glottal stops (which aren't
      written in standard Filipino spelling).
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use <code>rin</code> after words that end in <span class="fw-bold">vowel SOUNDS</span> or <code>n</code></li>
      <li>
        Use <code>din</code> after words that end in <span class="fw-bold">consonant SOUNDS</span>, including vowels
        with glottal stops.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      👉 This rule matches how native speakers naturally choose "rin/din" in speech, and is more accurate in real life.
