      <strong>Understanding the Filipino Particle "ay"</strong>
    </h4>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>
        <code>Ay</code> is a grammatical particle used in Filipino to mark an
        <strong>inverted sentence structure</strong>, especially in formal or written language.
      </p>

      <h5 class="mt-3">📘 Function</h5>
      <p>
        It separates the <strong>subject</strong> from the <strong>predicate</strong> and emphasizes the subject by
        placing it at the beginning of the sentence.
      </p>

      <h5 class="mt-3">🧠 Definitions</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Subject:</strong> The part of the sentence that tells us <em>who or what</em> the sentence is about.
          In Filipino, it's often marked by the word <code>ang</code>, although you don't need <code>ang</code> when the subject is a
          personal pronoun like <code>siya</code> (he/she), <code>ako</code> (I), or <code>sila</code> (they)..
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Predicate:</strong> The part of the sentence that tells us something <em>about the subject</em>, such
          as what they are doing, where they are from, or what they are. Predicate can contain multiple words, verbs, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Bascially a sentece can be divided into two <span class="fw-bold">BIG</span> parts, subjet and predicate.</p>

      <div class="card p-2">
        <p class="fw-bold">🤔 CONTEXT</p>
        <p>In Filipino, the natural or conversational sentence order is usually:</p>
        <p><code>PREDICATE ->  Subject</code></p>
        <p>(This is the opposite of English)</p>
        <p>Example: <code>Maganda siya</code></p>
        <p>Now inverting the structure: <code>Siya ay maganda</code></p>
      </div>

      <h5 class="mt-3">🧱 Structure</h5>
      <div class="p-2 rounded border">[subject] ay [predicate]</div>
      <p>This is known as the <strong>"ay-inverted" sentence structure</strong>.</p>

      <h5 class="mt-3">🗣️ Example</h5>
      <div>
        <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary">Siya ay aking tatay.</span>
        <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-success">He is my father.</span>
      </div>

      <h5 class="mt-3">💡 Notes</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>This structure is more formal and often found in written or academic Filipino.</li>
        <li>In everyday speech, the particle <code>ay</code> is often omitted or replaced by a more natural order.</li>
      </ul>
