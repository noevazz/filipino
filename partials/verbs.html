  <h4>Verbs</h4>

  <p>Verbs are action words that change depending on:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><kbd>Focus</kbd> (who or what the sentence is about).</li>
    <li>
      <kbd>Aspect</kbd> (whether the action is completed, ongoing, or not yet
      started).
    </li>
    <li><kbd>Voice</kbd> (like active or passive, tied closely to focus).</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="card bg-danger text-white my-4 p-2">
    Unlike English, Filipino verbs don't change with subject pronouns (I, you,
    he, she), but they change with what you're emphasizing in the sentence
    (actor or object).
  </div>

  <div class="card mb-2">
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="fw-bold">Focus</p>
      <p>
        Focus is what part of the sentence is being emphasized, is it the doer
        (actor), the object, the location, the beneficiary, etc.?
      </p>

      <p>
        So focus changes what role in the sentence is highlighted, and the verb
        affix changes accordingly.

        This shows when the action happens. It's not quite like tense
        (past/present/future) in English but focuses on completion.

        <li>
          <p>Completed (Perpektibo): the action is done</p>

  <div class="card mb-2">
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="fw-bold">VOICE</p>
      <p>
        Voice in Filipino is tightly connected to Focus — it tells you if the
        sentence is in active voice or passive voice.
      </p>
      <p>In other languages, like English:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Active: Ana ate the apple.</li>
        <li>Passive: The apple was eaten by Ana.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In Filipino, this is handled not by reordering words, but by changing
        the verb focus.

      <p>
        The action is the same (eating), but the focus (and thus the verb form)
        changes depending on who or what you want to highlight.
